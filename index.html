    <h1>Welcome to My Individual Project CPSC 581</h1>
    <p>I will upload 10 initial sketches, a storyboard and a demo video </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Below you will find my initial rough sketches. These sketches serve as the first drafts for the overall design layout and user interface of my project. They include concepts for the homepage, navigation structure, and mobile view, and provide a foundational view of my design approach before I move into detailed wireframes and prototyping.</p>

    <h2>Final Storyboard</h2>
    <p>
        Amongst the rough sketches, I chose <strong>Sketch 7</strong> as my final project because it closely resembles my vision for the user interface.
        I get blood in my nose, brittle hair and dry skin because Calgary has dry weather. So I have to turn on humidifer everytime. Often I get lazy and dont turn it on which causes me problems. So I thought it would be so cool to have smart humidifer
